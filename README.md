### About Me
Hi, my name is Michael Ardisa, You can call me Michael. I am a student from Bina Nusantara University, currently majoring in Game Application and Technology. As you can probably tell from my major, i love games and i love making them. I strive to be a great game programmer in the future.

I'm really passionate about developing games, especially in the Unity game engine. So far, i've been involved in 5 game development projects as both a developer and a sound engineer.

Do you know about the classic pong game that you used to be able to play on an old mobil phone? Neon Pong is basically just that, but you can also SMASH! You can play offline with a friend or you can try playing with bots with difficulty ranging from easy to hard.

Phase Jumper is a fast paced side scroller where the main character has the ability to teleport through objects! Try your best to finish the levels as fast as possible with as little deaths as possible. There are currently 3 levels and I'm planning to add more in the future!
